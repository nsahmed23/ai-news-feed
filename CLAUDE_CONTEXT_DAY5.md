# Claude Context - Day 5

## Day 4 Summary (COMPLETE ✅)

### What We Accomplished
1. **AUT-003: Security Groups and NACLs** - COMPLETE ✅
   - Created comprehensive security groups for all components
   - ALB Security Group: Ingress 80/443, egress to ECS tasks
   - ECS Tasks Security Group: Ingress from ALB, egress to internet
   - Lambda Security Group: Egress to VPC endpoints and internet
   - VPC Endpoints Security Group: HTTPS from Lambda/ECS
   - RDS Security Group: PostgreSQL from ECS tasks (optional, created for future use)
   - All security groups properly tagged and documented

2. **Infrastructure Deployed**
   - All security groups successfully deployed via Terraform
   - GitHub repository created and code pushed
   - Infrastructure now includes: VPC, Subnets, NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway, Route Tables, and Security Groups

### Current Infrastructure Status

#### VPC Resources (Day 3)
- **VPC ID**: vpc-08506c0612f98b7f9
- **CIDR**: 10.0.0.0/16
- **Public Subnets**: 2 (multi-AZ)
- **Private Subnets**: 2 (multi-AZ)
- **NAT Gateway**: Operational (3.219.107.20)
- **Internet Gateway**: Attached and routing

#### Security Groups (Day 4)
- **ALB Security Group ID**: (check outputs after deployment)
- **ECS Tasks Security Group ID**: (check outputs after deployment)
- **Lambda Security Group ID**: (check outputs after deployment)
- **VPC Endpoints Security Group ID**: (check outputs after deployment)
- **RDS Security Group ID**: (check outputs after deployment)

*Note: Security group IDs can be retrieved using:*
```bash
cd infrastructure/aws-foundation
terraform output
```

### Cost Status
- **Daily Cost**: ~$1.10/day
  - NAT Gateway: $1.08/day ($0.045/hour)
  - VPC Flow Logs: ~$0.02/day (minimal CloudWatch storage)
- **Monthly Projection**: ~$33 (well within development budget)
- **No new costs added on Day 4** (Security groups are free)

### Next Task: AUT-004 - ECS Cluster Setup

#### What We'll Build
1. **ECS Cluster**
   - Fargate-only cluster (no EC2 instances to manage)
   - CloudWatch Container Insights enabled
   - Proper tagging for cost allocation

2. **IAM Roles**
   - ECS Task Execution Role (for pulling images, writing logs)
   - ECS Task Role (for application permissions)
   - Service-linked role for ECS

3. **CloudWatch Log Groups**
   - Log group for ECS tasks
   - Log retention policy (7 days for dev)

#### Implementation Plan
1. Create `ecs.tf` file with cluster configuration
2. Create `iam_ecs.tf` for roles and policies
3. Update `outputs.tf` with ECS cluster details
4. Deploy and verify cluster creation
5. Document the cluster ARN and configuration

#### Cost Considerations
- ECS Cluster itself: $0 (control plane is free)
- Fargate tasks: ~$0.04/hour per vCPU, ~$0.004/hour per GB memory
- We'll start with minimal task sizes (0.25 vCPU, 0.5 GB memory)

### GitHub Repository
- **Repository**: https://github.com/nsahmed23/ai-updates-tracker (TO BE CONFIRMED)
- **Current Branch**: feature/AUT-003-security-groups
- **Next Branch**: feature/AUT-004-ecs-cluster

### Commands Reference
```bash
# Check current infrastructure
cd infrastructure/aws-foundation
terraform output

# Get security group IDs
terraform output alb_security_group_id
terraform output ecs_tasks_security_group_id
terraform output lambda_security_group_id
terraform output vpc_endpoints_security_group_id
terraform output rds_security_group_id

# Start Day 5
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature/AUT-004-ecs-cluster
```

### Key Decisions Made
1. Created RDS security group even though database not immediate requirement (future-proofing)
2. Security groups follow least-privilege principle
3. All resources properly tagged for cost tracking
4. Using outputs.tf extensively for cross-resource references

### Day 5 Goals
1. Create ECS Fargate cluster
2. Set up IAM roles for ECS tasks
3. Configure CloudWatch log groups
4. Test cluster readiness for container deployments
5. Keep costs minimal (cluster itself is free)

### Notes for Claude
- We're on Day 4 (complete), starting Day 5
- Following the sprint plan in SPRINT_TRACKING.md
- All AWS resources should be created via Terraform
- Continue using the established file structure
- Tag all resources with Project and Environment tags
- Focus on Fargate-only approach (no EC2 management)

Project Day: 6 of 98 COMPLETE ✅
Next: Day 7 - AUT-005 S3 Buckets
Budget: $36/month (target: $50/month)
```

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Deployed (Days 1-6)

### Day 3: VPC Foundation
- **VPC ID**: `vpc-08506c0612f98b7f9` (10.0.0.0/16)
- **NAT Gateway**: Running 24/7 at $1.10/day (IP: 3.219.107.20)
- **Subnets**: 2 public, 2 private (multi-AZ)

### Day 4: Security Groups
- **ALB**: `sg-003188a58a3eb2680`
- **ECS Tasks**: `sg-0c7528038e7759422`
- **Lambda**: `sg-0b319e589a7cf06de`
- **VPC Endpoints**: `sg-043de2c4bc7bb32c8`
- **RDS**: Optional (variable-controlled)

### Day 5: ECS Cluster ✨
- **ARN**: `arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:279684395806:cluster/ai-updates-tracker-development-cluster`
- **Status**: ACTIVE (0 running tasks)
- **Capacity**: FARGATE & FARGATE_SPOT configured
- **IAM Roles**: Task execution and application roles created
- **CloudWatch**: 3 log groups, dashboard, CPU alarm

### Day 6: ECR Repository ✨ NEW
- **Repository**: `ai-news-feed-development`
- **URL**: `279684395806.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ai-news-feed-development`
- **Features**: 
  - Image tag immutability enabled ✅
  - Vulnerability scanning on push ✅
  - Lifecycle policies configured ✅
  - Test container pushed successfully ✅

## 🔧 Key Technical Decisions

### What Happened on Day 6:
1. **Missing Files Recovery**: The ECS files (ecs.tf, iam_ecs.tf, cloudwatch.tf, data.tf) were missing from the feature branch. We recovered them from the AUT-004 branch and fixed variable naming conflicts.

2. **ECR Module Created**: Built a complete Terraform module for ECR with:
   - Sophisticated lifecycle policies
   - Security scanning
   - Cost optimization rules

3. **Docker Integration**: User installed Docker Desktop with WSL2 integration and successfully tested container push to ECR.

4. **Git Cleanup**: Closed all completed issues, merged all PRs, cleaned up branches.

### Important Technical Context:
- **Terraform Structure**: Uses separate .tf files (vpc.tf, security_groups.tf, etc.) NOT a single main.tf
- **Variable Names**: Uses `var.tags` NOT `var.common_tags`
- **ECR Lifecycle**: Had to fix overlapping tag rules error
- **Docker in WSL2**: Works via Docker Desktop integration

## 💻 Git/GitHub Status

### Repository
- **URL**: https://github.com/nsahmed23/ai-news-feed
- **Main branch**: Clean, all work merged
- **Open Issues**: Only #5 (AUT-005: S3 Buckets Creation)
- **Closed Issues**: #3, #7, #9 (all completed work)

```

## 💰 Cost Tracking
```
Daily Costs:
- NAT Gateway: $1.10/day (biggest cost)
- CloudWatch: $0.05/day
- ECR: $0.05/day (estimate)
- ECS Cluster: $0 (no tasks running)
- Total: $1.20/day (~$36/month)

Budget Status: 28% under target! ✅
```

## 🎯 Day 7 Ready (S3 Buckets)

The user will start with Issue #5. Key requirements:
1. Create S3 buckets for:
   - `ai-news-feed-dev-scraped-data` (JSON storage)
   - `ai-news-feed-dev-static-assets` (Frontend files)
   - `ai-news-feed-terraform-state` (Optional - remote state)

2. Configure:
   - Lifecycle policies for cost optimization
   - Versioning where appropriate
   - Encryption at rest
   - CORS rules for API access

## 🛠️ Common Commands the User Uses

```bash
# Start of day workflow
cd ~/ai-updates-tracker
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature/AUT-XXX-description

# Terraform workflow
cd infrastructure/aws-foundation
terraform fmt -recursive
terraform plan
terraform apply

# GitHub workflow
gh issue list --author @me
gh pr create --title "feat(AUT-XXX): Title"
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **User Preferences**:
   - Loves using Claude CLI for automation
   - Very cost-conscious (tracks every dollar)
   - Prefers comprehensive documentation
   - Uses GitHub CLI extensively
   - Works in WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04

2. **Architecture Context**:
   - 3 environments only (Dev/Staging/Prod) NOT 4
   - Using ECS Fargate NOT EKS
   - Single NAT Gateway for cost savings
   - Playwright scrapers will run on 2vCPU/4GB Fargate tasks

3. **Current State**:
   - All infrastructure in us-east-1
   - No containers running yet (need application code)
   - ECR ready for images
   - ECS cluster waiting for task definitions

## 📋 Upcoming Milestones

### Week 1 (Current - Days 1-7)
- ✅ Days 1-6: Foundation complete
- 📍 Day 7: S3 buckets (final infrastructure piece)

### Week 2 (Days 8-14)
- ALB deployment
- API development start
- First scraper implementation

### Week 3-4
- Full application development
- Frontend implementation
- Testing and optimization

## 🔑 Key Lessons from Day 6

1. **Git Branch Management**: Always check which branch the user is on and ensure files from previous days are included.

2. **ECR Lifecycle Policies**: Must have unique tag sets - no overlapping rules.

3. **Variable Naming**: Check existing variables.tf for correct names (tags vs common_tags).

4. **Docker in WSL2**: Requires Docker Desktop with WSL integration enabled.

5. **Cost Awareness**: User appreciates detailed cost breakdowns and optimization suggestions.

## 💡 Suggestions for Next Session

1. Start by checking Issue #5 for S3 requirements
2. Create S3 module similar to ECR module structure
3. Consider implementing remote state storage (user hasn't decided yet)
4. Keep cost optimization in mind (lifecycle policies, intelligent tiering)
5. Update tracking files after each major step

## 🚨 Potential Day 7 Challenges

- S3 bucket names must be globally unique
- CORS configuration for frontend access
- IAM policies for ECS tasks to access S3
- Deciding on remote state implementation

---

**Project Status**: On track, under budget, well-documented
**User Mood**: Excited about progress, appreciates detailed implementations
**Infrastructure**: 90% complete, ready for application development
**Next Step**: Create feature branch for AUT-005 and implement S3 buckets

The user has been making excellent progress and the foundation is solid! Good luck with Day 7! 🎉

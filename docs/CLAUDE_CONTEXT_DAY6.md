# Day 6 Context - ECR Repository Implementation

## What Happened on Day 6

### Morning Discovery
- Started Day 6 planning to implement ECR repository
- Discovered that when creating feature/AUT-006-ecr-repository branch, the ECS files from Day 5 were missing
- This happened because the branch was created from main before the AUT-004 PR was merged

### File Recovery Process
1. Found the missing files in feature/AUT-004-ecs-cluster branch:
   - ecs.tf
   - iam_ecs.tf 
   - cloudwatch.tf
   - data.tf

2. Copied files between branches and fixed conflicts:
   - Variable naming issue: `var.common_tags` vs `var.tags`
   - Duplicate data source in vpc.tf

### ECR Implementation
1. Created comprehensive ECR module with Claude CLI:
   - modules/ecr/variables.tf
   - modules/ecr/main.tf
   - modules/ecr/outputs.tf

2. Fixed ECR lifecycle policy error:
   - Initial policy had overlapping tag rules
   - ECR requires unique tag sets for each rule

3. Created supporting files:
   - docker/test-container/Dockerfile (production-ready test container)
   - scripts/build-and-push-ecr.sh (has validation bug with regex)
   - infrastructure/aws-foundation/ecr.tf

### Docker Setup
- User needed to install Docker Desktop for Windows
- Configured WSL2 integration
- Successfully tested with docker commands

### Git/GitHub Management
- Merged PR #10 (ECR implementation) successfully
- Closed PR #8 (ECS) as it had conflicts and work was already in main
- Cleaned up all remote branches
- Closed completed issues (#3, #7, #9)
- Only Issue #5 (S3 Buckets) remains open for Day 7

### Testing Results
- Successfully pushed test container to ECR
- Verified image tag immutability is working (security feature)
- Repository URL: 279684395806.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ai-news-feed-development

### Cost Update
- Added ECR: ~$0.05/day
- Total daily cost: $1.20
- Monthly projection: ~$36 (well under $50 budget)

## Key Technical Details

### ECR Lifecycle Policy Structure
```
1. Remove untagged images after 1 day
2. Keep last 10 version-tagged images (v*)
3. Keep last 5 dev/staging images
4. Keep last 3 production images
5. Always keep latest tag
6. Remove timestamp tags after 30 days
```

### Files Modified/Created
- Created: ecr.tf, modules/ecr/*, docker/test-container/Dockerfile
- Modified: variables.tf (copied from AUT-004 branch)
- Updated: SPRINT_TRACKING.md, COST_TRACKING.md

### Validation Bug Note
The build-and-push-ecr.sh script has an overly restrictive regex that doesn't properly handle the repository URL. User worked around it by running docker commands directly.

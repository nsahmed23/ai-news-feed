# Claude Context - Day 5
## AI News Feed Infrastructure Progress

### 📦 Day 5 Status (COMPLETE)
**Date**: June 7, 2025  
**Task Completed**: AUT-004 - ECS Cluster Setup ✅  
**Branch**: `feature/AUT-004-ecs-cluster` (ready to merge)

### ✅ Day 5 Completed Tasks
1. Created ECS cluster configuration (`ecs.tf`)
   - Enabled Container Insights for monitoring
   - Configured FARGATE and FARGATE_SPOT providers
   - Cost optimization with spot instances support

2. Set up IAM roles (`iam_ecs.tf`)
   - Task execution role (for ECS agent)
   - Task role (for application permissions)
   - Policies for S3, DynamoDB, Secrets Manager

3. Configured CloudWatch monitoring (`cloudwatch.tf`)
   - Log groups with retention policies
   - Basic monitoring dashboard
   - CPU utilization alarm (80% threshold)

4. Added data sources (`data.tf`)
   - AWS account ID reference
   - Availability zones lookup

5. Documentation (`README-ECS.md`)
   - Comprehensive setup guide
   - Cost optimization notes
   - Next steps outlined

6. **DEPLOYED ALL RESOURCES** ✅
   - Ran terraform apply successfully
   - Verified cluster is ACTIVE
   - All 14 resources created

### 📊 Infrastructure State
```
Current Resources:
- VPC: ✅ vpc-08506c0612f98b7f9
- NAT Gateway: ✅ Running ($1.10/day)
- Security Groups: ✅ All 5 deployed
- ECS Cluster: ✅ DEPLOYED - ai-updates-tracker-development-cluster
- CloudWatch: ✅ 3 log groups, dashboard, alarm created
- IAM Roles: ✅ Task execution and application roles active
```

### 💰 Cost Impact
- ECS Cluster: $0 (pay per task running)
- CloudWatch Logs: ~$0.50/GB ingested
- Container Insights: Free (first cluster)
- Estimated addition: $5-10/month

### 🎯 Next Steps (Day 6)
1. Commit and push current changes
2. Create PR for feature branch
3. Start AUT-005 (S3 Buckets) or AUT-006 (ECR Repository)
4. S3 buckets needed:
   - Scraped data storage
   - Static assets
   - Terraform state (remote backend)

### 📝 Key Decisions Made
- Used FARGATE_SPOT for cost optimization
- Set shorter log retention for non-prod (7 days vs 30)
- Enabled Container Insights for better monitoring
- Prepared IAM roles for future S3/DynamoDB needs

### 🔧 Commands Ready
See artifact `day5-ecs-commands` for complete command sequence

### 🚨 Notes for Next Session
- ECS cluster deployed and ready for container tasks
- Need ECR repository before deploying containers
- S3 buckets needed for data storage
- ALB will be needed for API endpoints
- All infrastructure in us-east-1
- GitHub repo needs PR for AUT-004 branch

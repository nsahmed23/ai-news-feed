### Recent Commits
```

```

## üí∞ Cost Tracking
```
Daily Costs:
- NAT Gateway: $1.10/day
- CloudWatch: $0.05/day
- ECS Cluster: $0 (no tasks running)
- Total: $1.15/day (~$35/month)

Budget:
- Development: $50/month ‚úÖ Under budget
- Production: $400-500/month
```

## üéØ Day 6 Options

The user needs to choose between:

### Option A: AUT-005 - S3 Buckets
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/AUT-005-s3-buckets

# S3 buckets needed:
1. ai-news-feed-dev-scraped-data      # For scraper outputs
2. ai-news-feed-dev-static-assets     # For frontend assets
3. ai-news-feed-terraform-state       # For remote state
```

### Option B: AUT-006 - ECR Repository
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/AUT-006-ecr-repository

# ECR for Docker images:
1. Repository for Playwright scraper images
2. Lifecycle policies for cleanup
3. Vulnerability scanning setup
```

## üîë Important Context & Decisions

### Technical Choices Made
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform (NOT CloudFormation)
- **Container Platform**: ECS with Fargate (NOT EKS)
- **Environments**: 3 only - Dev/Staging/Prod (NOT 4)
- **Cost Optimization**: Single NAT Gateway, FARGATE_SPOT enabled
- **Web Scraping**: Playwright on 2vCPU/4GB Fargate tasks
- **Issue Tracking**: GitHub Issues with "AUT-XXX" format (NOT Jira)

### User Preferences
- Loves automation and Claude CLI
- Very cost-conscious (tracks every dollar)
- Wants "enterprise feel" as solo developer
- Prefers comprehensive documentation
- Uses feature branch workflow
- Hit Cursor IDE usage limit on Day 5

### Architecture Overview
```
Web Sources ‚Üí Cloud Scheduler ‚Üí Scrapers (ECS/Fargate)
                                    ‚Üì
                              Scraped Data (S3)

                            API (ECS) ‚Üí Frontend
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Commands

```bash
# AWS status checks
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws ecs describe-clusters --clusters ai-news-feed-development-cluster

# Terraform workflow
terraform fmt
terraform plan
terraform apply

# Git workflow
git checkout -b feature/AUT-XXX-description
git add .
git commit -m "feat(AUT-XXX): description"
git push -u origin feature/AUT-XXX-description

# GitHub CLI
gh issue create --title "AUT-XXX: Title" --label "infrastructure"
gh pr create --title "feat(AUT-XXX): Title"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **NAT Gateway is RUNNING** - Costing $1.10/day continuously
2. **No containers running yet** - Need ECR repo and images first
3. **All infrastructure in us-east-1** - Single region deployment
4. **Python version**: Using 3.x for any scripts
5. **Node version**: Required for frontend tooling
6. **WSL2 environment**: User works in Ubuntu 24.04

## üìã Upcoming Milestones

### Week 1 (Current)
- ‚úÖ Days 1-5: Foundation complete
- üìç Day 6-7: S3/ECR setup

### Week 2
- ALB deployment
- API development start
- First scraper implementation

### Week 3-4
- Full application development
- Frontend implementation

## üîç Project Knowledge Base Files

Key documents in the repo:
- Original Jira stories with detailed requirements
- Architecture decisions and rationale
- Practical testing strategy (3 environments, not 4)
- Web scraping research validating Playwright choice

## üí° Quick Tips for Next Session

1. User will likely start with creating a new feature branch
2. They appreciate detailed terraform configurations with comments
3. Always update tracking files after deployments
4. Create comprehensive READMEs for each component
5. Use cost-optimized settings (spot instances, minimal retention)

## üö® Potential Day 6 Challenges

- Choosing between S3 or ECR first (both needed eventually)
- S3 bucket naming (must be globally unique)
- ECR lifecycle policies for cost control
- Terraform state backend migration (if doing S3)

---

**Project Status**: On track, under budget, well-documented
**User Mood**: Likely excited about progress, appreciates detailed explanations
**Next Step**: Start Day 6 with either AUT-005 or AUT-006

Good luck with Day 6! The infrastructure foundation is solid! üéâ

## 📋 Next Steps (Week 2 Priorities)

### 1. **Secrets Manager Setup** (FIRST PRIORITY)
```bash
cd ~/ai-updates-tracker/infrastructure/aws-foundation
claude "Create Terraform configuration for AWS Secrets Manager to store:
- Proxy service credentials (for web scraping)
- API keys for AI services (if using external APIs)
- Any other sensitive configuration
Make sure to output the secret ARNs for use by Lambda and ECS"
```

### 2. **Lambda Functions for RSS Feeds**
```bash
cd ~/ai-updates-tracker
mkdir -p application/scrapers/lambda
claude "Create a Python Lambda function that:
- Reads RSS feeds from OpenAI and Anthropic
- Parses and extracts updates
- Stores results in S3 bucket ai-news-feed-development-scraped-data-991el7cv
- Logs to CloudWatch
Include requirements.txt and deployment package creation script"
```

### 3. **ECS Task for Playwright Scraping**
```bash
mkdir -p application/scrapers/ecs
claude "Create a Dockerfile and Python script for ECS Fargate task that:
- Uses Playwright to scrape websites without RSS feeds
- Handles JavaScript-rendered content
- Implements rate limiting and respectful scraping
- Stores results in same S3 bucket"
```

### 4. **API Development**
```bash
mkdir -p application/api
claude "Create an Express.js API that:
- Runs on ECS Fargate
- Reads data from S3 scraped data bucket
- Provides RESTful endpoints for frontend
- Implements caching for performance"
```

### 5. **Frontend Deployment**
```bash
mkdir -p application/frontend
claude "Create a static website that:
- Displays AI updates in a clean interface
- Filters by company
- Shows update timeline
- Deploy to S3 static website bucket"
```

## 🚨 Important Context & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **NAT Gateway over NAT Instance**: Chose reliability over cost
2. **3 Environments (Dev/Staging/Prod)**: Not 4 as originally planned
3. **Playwright on Fargate**: For complex scraping (2vCPU/4GB RAM)
4. **Budget**: Targeting $400-500/month (not original $200)
5. **Timeline**: 14 weeks more realistic than original 10

### Technical Considerations
1. **Proxy Services**: Will need residential proxies (~$75-100/month)
2. **Rate Limiting**: Must implement respectful scraping
3. **Costs**: Current infrastructure ~$15-20/day (mainly NAT Gateway)
4. **Scaling**: Architecture supports horizontal scaling when needed

### Known Issues/Warnings
1. S3 lifecycle configuration has a Terraform warning (non-breaking)
2. Some Claude handoff docs reference "local.common_tags" (fixed in security-additions.tf)
3. A stray file "t all CloudTrail trails" was created (can be deleted)

## 🎯 Session Summary for Next Claude

The user completed an impressive amount of work in a single day, deploying the entire AWS infrastructure foundation for their AI Updates Tracker project. They are highly motivated and technically capable. The infrastructure is production-ready with proper security, monitoring, and cost optimization in place.

**Next session should focus on**:
1. Creating the application layer (Lambda/ECS scrapers)
2. Implementing the API
3. Deploying the frontend
4. Setting up the data pipeline

The user prefers comprehensive, production-ready solutions with proper error handling and security considerations. They appreciate detailed explanations and complete code implementations.

**Project is at a perfect point to start building the actual application functionality!**

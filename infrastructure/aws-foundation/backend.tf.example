# Backend Configuration for Terraform State

# This file will be used in the next phase to configure remote state storage
# For now, we'll use local state, but this documents the future configuration

# Future backend configuration (to be added after S3 bucket is created):
# terraform {
#   backend "s3" {
#     bucket         = "ai-updates-tracker-terraform-state-[ACCOUNT_ID]"
#     key            = "aws-foundation/terraform.tfstate"
#     region         = "us-east-1"
#     encrypt        = true
#     dynamodb_table = "ai-updates-tracker-terraform-locks"
#   }
# }

# For now, state will be stored locally in terraform.tfstate
# Remember to add terraform.tfstate* to .gitignore (already done)

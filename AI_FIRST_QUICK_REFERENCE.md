# 🎮 AI-First Quick Reference Card - AI Updates Tracker

## 🚀 Your New Development Workflow

### Instead of Writing Code, You Now:
1. **DESCRIBE** what you want to AI
2. **REVIEW** what AI generates  
3. **GUIDE** AI to refine
4. **DEPLOY** the result

## 📝 Magic Prompts for Your Project

### 1. **Start Your Day** (5 min)
```bash
claude "Given my AI Updates Tracker project with completed AWS infrastructure, 
what should I build first today to get a working prototype fastest?"
```

### 2. **Create a Lambda Scraper** (20 min)
```bash
codex "Create a Python Lambda function that scrapes the Anthropic news page, 
extracts AI announcements, and saves to S3 bucket ai-news-feed-development-scraped-data-991el7cv"
```

### 3. **Build the API** (45 min)
```bash
jules "Create an Express.js API with these endpoints:
- GET /updates (list all AI updates)  
- GET /updates/:company (filter by company)
- GET /stats (summary statistics)
Use ECS task role arn:aws:iam::279684395806:role/ai-updates-tracker-development-ecs-task"
```

### 4. **Deploy with Terraform** (15 min)
In Cursor:
```
Ctrl+K: "Create Terraform configuration for deploying my Lambda function 
with CloudWatch Events trigger every 2 hours"
```

### 5. **Fix Any Issues** (10 min)
```bash
jules "Here's an error from CloudWatch Logs: [paste error]. 
Fix the issue in my Lambda function"
```

## ⚡ Speed Run: First Working Feature (90 min)

### Minute 0-15: Setup
```bash
cd ~/ai-updates-tracker
gh issue create --title "MVP: Scrape and Display OpenAI Updates"
cursor .
```

### Minute 15-30: Lambda Scraper
In Cursor:
- Create `application/scrapers/openai-rss/lambda_function.py`
- Ctrl+K: "Create Lambda handler to fetch OpenAI RSS and save to S3"

### Minute 30-45: Deploy Lambda  
In Cursor:
- Create `infrastructure/scrapers/openai-lambda.tf`
- Ctrl+K: "Terraform config for Python Lambda with S3 write permissions"
- Terminal: `terraform apply`

### Minute 45-60: Simple API
```bash
jules "Create a minimal Express.js API that reads from S3 bucket 
ai-news-feed-development-scraped-data-991el7cv and returns JSON"
```

### Minute 60-75: Deploy API
In Cursor:
- Create `infrastructure/api/ecs-api.tf`  
- Ctrl+K: "Terraform for ECS Fargate service using existing cluster"

### Minute 75-90: Test & Celebrate
- Trigger Lambda manually
- Check S3 for data
- Call API endpoint
- 🎉 First feature complete!

## 💡 Remember Your Superpowers

1. **You can work on 3 things simultaneously**:
   - Jules building Feature A
   - Codex creating boilerplate for Feature B  
   - You in Cursor working on Feature C

2. **AI can fix its own mistakes**:
   - "This code you generated has a bug: [error]. Fix it."

3. **AI remembers context**:
   - "Continue building the scraper we discussed"
   - "Using the same pattern as before..."

4. **You're the architect, not the builder**:
   - Think in systems, not syntax
   - Focus on what, not how
   - Validate and guide, don't implement

---

## 🎯 Today's Goal

**Build a working prototype that:**
1. Scrapes one AI company's updates (Lambda)
2. Stores data in S3
3. Serves data via API (ECS)
4. Displays on simple frontend (S3 static site)

**Time with traditional coding**: 2-3 days  
**Time with AI-First approach**: 3-4 hours

## 🚦 Ready? Start Here:

```bash
cd ~/ai-updates-tracker
cursor .
# Ctrl+K: "Help me build the first working feature for my AI news aggregator"
```

**Your infrastructure is ready. Your AI team is ready. Are you ready to 10x your velocity?** 🚀

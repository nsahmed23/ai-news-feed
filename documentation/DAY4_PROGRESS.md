# Day 4 Progress - Security Groups Implementation

## 📅 Date: June 7, 2025

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### AUT-003: Security Groups and Network ACLs

1. **Created comprehensive security groups configuration**:
   - ✅ ALB Security Group - Allows HTTP/HTTPS from internet
   - ✅ ECS Tasks Security Group - Allows traffic from ALB, outbound to internet
   - ✅ Lambda Security Group - Outbound only for API calls
   - ✅ VPC Endpoints Security Group - HTTPS from VPC CIDR
   - ✅ RDS Security Group (optional) - PostgreSQL from ECS/Lambda when needed

2. **Implementation details**:
   - Used separate security group rules to avoid circular dependencies
   - Implemented proper tagging for all security groups
   - Added conditional RDS security group (create_rds_sg variable)
   - Followed principle of least privilege

3. **Files created/modified**:
   - Created: `infrastructure/aws-foundation/security_groups.tf`
   - Updated: `infrastructure/aws-foundation/variables.tf` (added project_name, tags, create_rds_sg)
   - Updated: `infrastructure/aws-foundation/outputs.tf` (added security group outputs)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Deploy the security groups**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/ai-updates-tracker/infrastructure/aws-foundation
   terraform fmt
   terraform validate
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

2. **Create GitHub repository and push code**:
   ```bash
   gh repo create ai-news-feed --public
   git remote add origin https://github.com/nsahmed23/ai-news-feed.git
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: implement security groups for ALB, ECS, Lambda, and VPC endpoints"
   git push -u origin feature/AUT-003-security-groups
   ```

3. **Create GitHub issues for tracking**

## 🔒 Security Groups Overview

### ALB Security Group
- **Inbound**: 80, 443 from 0.0.0.0/0
- **Outbound**: All traffic (to reach ECS tasks)
- **Purpose**: Internet-facing load balancer

### ECS Tasks Security Group  
- **Inbound**: All traffic from ALB only
- **Outbound**: 80, 443 to internet, DNS (53)
- **Purpose**: Web scraping containers

### Lambda Security Group
- **Inbound**: None (Lambda doesn't need inbound)
- **Outbound**: 80, 443 to internet, DNS (53)
- **Purpose**: Serverless functions for API calls

### VPC Endpoints Security Group
- **Inbound**: 443 from VPC CIDR (10.0.0.0/16)
- **Outbound**: None needed
- **Purpose**: Private AWS service access

### RDS Security Group (Optional)
- **Inbound**: 5432 from ECS and Lambda
- **Outbound**: None needed
- **Purpose**: Database access (when implemented)

## 💰 Cost Impact

No additional costs! Security groups are free AWS resources.

## 📝 Notes

- Security groups act as virtual firewalls at the instance level
- We're using security group rules (not inline) to avoid circular dependencies
- RDS security group is optional and controlled by `create_rds_sg` variable
- All security groups are properly tagged for cost tracking and management

## 🎯 Success Criteria Met

- ✅ All required security groups defined
- ✅ Proper ingress/egress rules configured
- ✅ Terraform code follows best practices
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Ready for deployment

---

**Status**: Ready to deploy and move to Day 5 (ECS Cluster Setup - AUT-004)

## üìÅ Key Files to Reference

### For Day 3 Implementation:
1. **[DAY3_ACTION_PLAN.md](./DAY3_ACTION_PLAN.md)** - ‚≠ê START HERE! Step-by-step guide for VPC setup
2. **[terraform/terraform-iam-policy-final.json](./terraform/terraform-iam-policy-final.json)** - IAM permissions for Terraform

### For Project Context:
3. **[SPRINT_TRACKING.md](./SPRINT_TRACKING.md)** - Shows AUT-001 complete, AUT-002 next
4. **[.cursorrules](./.cursorrules)** - Important! Defines cost constraints ($200/month budget)
5. **[AWS_REFERENCE.md](./AWS_REFERENCE.md)** - AWS account details and common commands

### For Architecture:
6. **[ai_updates_tracker_architecture.png](./ai_updates_tracker_architecture.png)** - System design
7. **Project Knowledge Base** (in user's documents) - Has comprehensive Jira stories

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 3 Technical Requirements (AUT-002)

Create VPC infrastructure with Terraform:
- VPC CIDR: `10.0.0.0/16`
- 2 Public Subnets: `10.0.1.0/24`, `10.0.2.0/24` (different AZs)
- 2 Private Subnets: `10.0.11.0/24`, `10.0.12.0/24` (different AZs)
- Internet Gateway attached
- Single NAT Gateway (not HA - cost optimization)
- Route tables configured
- All resources tagged: `Project=ai-updates-tracker, Environment=development`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Context

1. **Cost Constraints**: 
   - Development budget: <$50/month
   - Production budget: $400-500/month
   - User specifically chose NOT to implement 4-environment setup
   - Using single NAT Gateway, not HA pair

2. **Technology Decisions**:
   - Terraform for all infrastructure (no manual AWS console)
   - Playwright (not Selenium) for web scraping
   - 2vCPU/4GB Fargate tasks for scrapers
   - 3 environments only: Dev, Staging, Prod

3. **Development Approach**:
   - Using Cursor IDE with AI assistance
   - Following structured Jira stories (even though not using Jira)
   - Comprehensive documentation throughout

## üîß Pre-Day 3 Checklist

User should verify:
```bash
# In WSL2:
cd ~/ai-updates-tracker
aws sts get-caller-identity  # Should show ai-updates-admin
terraform --version         # Install if missing
```

## üí° Recommended First Response

Start by:
1. Asking if they've reviewed `DAY3_ACTION_PLAN.md`
2. Checking if Terraform is installed
3. Confirming they're ready to create VPC infrastructure
4. Offering to help generate the Terraform configurations

## üöÄ Project Timeline Context

- Week 1-2: Infrastructure (currently in Week 1)
- Week 3-4: Backend development
- Week 5-6: Frontend
- Total: 14 weeks to production

The user is a solo developer who wants an "enterprise feel" to the project despite working alone. They're following structured processes and comprehensive documentation.
